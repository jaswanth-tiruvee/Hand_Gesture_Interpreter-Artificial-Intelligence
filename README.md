# Hand_Gesture_Interpreter-Artificial Intelligence


This project explores new ways to combine traditional radar signal processing techniques with data-driven machine learning approaches to build a robust hand gesture recognition system. The goal is to enhance human-computer interaction (HCI) through hand gestures, specifically developing models for sign language recognition to aid communication for the deaf and hard of hearing. The project also compares the use of various sensors such as cameras, radar, and MediaPipe to determine the most efficient gesture recognition method.

Dataset
Google Soli Gesture Dataset
This dataset contains preprocessed Range-Doppler Image sequences for various hand gestures, captured by the Google Soli radar sensor. The data is saved in HDF5 format with labels corresponding to different gesture IDs. The radar captures subtle hand motions through high temporal resolution, making it suitable for recognizing complex gestures.

Models
CNN-Based Gesture Recognition
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for processing Range-Doppler Images.
Deep CNN & LSTM models are used for time-sequential data (e.g., dynamic gestures).
MediaPipe Keypoint Detection
Uses MediaPipeâ€™s machine learning pipeline to extract key points of the hand and perform gesture classification.

Challenges
Latency: Image processing for gesture recognition can introduce delays, which is unacceptable in real-time applications like video games or robotic controls.
Robustness: Ensuring gesture recognition works across lighting conditions, backgrounds, and user variations.
Data Variability: Different users make gestures differently, complicating the recognition process.


Future Work
Further improvements in gesture recognition using 3D CNNs and optimization techniques.
Expanding the sign language recognition model to cover more languages and gestures.
Real-time implementation of gesture recognition in low-resource environments such as mobile devices.
Improved accuracy in radar-based gesture recognition using advanced machine learning techniques like Spiking Neural Networks.
